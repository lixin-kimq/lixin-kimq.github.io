## Fork VS genarate

Creating a repository from a template is similar to forking a repository, but there are important differences:

+ A new fork includes the entire commit history of the parent repository, while a repository created from a template starts with a single commit.
+ Commits to a fork don't appear in your contributions graph, while commits to a repository created from a template do appear in your contribution graph.
+ A fork can be a temporary way to contribute code to an existing project, while creating a repository from a template starts a new project quickly.
